From Blake:

I wrote a little script that helps to verify data (files, registry keys, URLs) from multiple sources. Lets just say you used Ivan's scripts for generating MAEC output from ThreatExpert and Anubis for a file. 

Please email blake [-] at [-] jeek.org if you would like to suggest features or bugs.

Here is what you might expect as output:

$ ./compare_maec.py
threatexpert_maec.xml anubis_maec.xml idefense_maec.xml
