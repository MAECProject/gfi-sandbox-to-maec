MAEC -> OVAL Translation Example

This is a basic example of a MAEC file (maec_example.xml) with a few actions (file/registry key creation and manipulation) that was converted into its OVAL equivalent (oval_output.xml) using the command 'python maec_to_oval.py -i maec_example.xml -o oval_output.xml'
